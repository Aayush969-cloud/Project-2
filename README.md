Intrusion Detection System (IDS)



Overview
The Intrusion Detection System is a machine learning-powered application that identifies potential network intrusions by analyzing traffic patterns. It uses the NSL-KDD dataset for training and supports real-time detection.


Features
Preprocessing Pipeline: Cleans and preprocesses raw network data for analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms like Random Forest and SVM for accurate intrusion detection.
Real-Time Analysis: Detects anomalies in live network traffic.
Interactive Reports: Visualizes results and highlights potential threats.
Scalable Design: Easily adaptable to larger datasets or advanced detection mechanisms.



Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
Dataset: NSL-KDD



Setup Instructions
Clone the repository: git clone <repo-link>
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script: python intrusion_detection.py
Visualize results using the interactive UI or terminal logs.



Use Cases
Monitoring enterprise networks for unauthorized access
Enhancing the security of cloud or on-premise systems
